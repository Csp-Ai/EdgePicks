Summary:
- Codex audit `codex:edgepicks-prep-beta-ux-polish` completed for public beta readiness.
- Evaluated visual hierarchy, clarity, toggle logic, confidence meter labels, glossary usage, and first-load UX.
- Logged improvements needed for mobile responsiveness, tooltip accessibility, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
- Recommends glossary CTA, better toggle labels, confidence meter text, and layout polish for ADHD-friendliness.
- Treats llms.txt and README.md as living documents for agent state alignment.
Testing:
- Manual UX audit — passed
