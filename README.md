# ðŸ§  EdgePicks

EdgePicks is an AI-powered research assistant for Pickâ€™em players, analysts, and fans. It combines modular agent logic and transparent reasoning to surface smart, explainable picks across matchupsâ€”whether you're tracking football, basketball, baseball, or beyond.

## ðŸš€ Beta Launch

```sh
git clone https://github.com/edgepicks/EdgePicks.git
cd EdgePicks
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## ðŸ§¾ System Changelog: llms.txt

All Codex-driven changes, prompt pushes, and architecture modifications are documented in [`llms.txt`](llms.txt).  
This file serves as the **Codex constitution** and **single source of truth** for:

- What each agent does
- Why a prompt was executed
- What changed (code, logic, UI)
- When it was tested and deployed

**All future agents and developers must reference `llms.txt` before executing changes.**  
The README reflects system-level intent. The `llms.txt` file reflects execution history, behavior shifts, and rationale.

## Git Hooks

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) to manage Git hooks. A pre-push hook runs `npm run postpush`, which executes `scripts/log-llms-entry.ts` and appends the latest commit details to `llms.txt`.

## Features

- Live predictions panel
- Transparency dashboards
- Accuracy leaderboards
- Upcoming games sourced from TheSportsDB with betting odds from OddsAPI

## Project Purpose

EdgePicks helps users make informed predictions by aggregating insights from lightweight, explainable agents. Each agent contributes a score and rationale, allowing users to understand not just what to pickâ€”but why.

## Agent Architecture

Agents live in `lib/agents/` and return an `AgentResult` describing:

- the favored team
- a confidence score
- the reasoning behind the pick

Current agents include:

- `injuryScout` â€“ scans injury data for potential advantages  
- `lineWatcher` â€“ monitors line movement for sharp betting behavior  
- `statCruncher` â€“ evaluates team performance and efficiency  
- `trendsAgent` â€“ analyzes historical and momentum trends  
- `guardianAgent` â€“ raises warnings on risky or inconsistent picks  

`pickBot` â€“ orchestrator that aggregates all agent scores into a final recommendation.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for detailed agent metadata.  
Prompt formats and guidelines are documented in [`agent-prompts.md`](agent-prompts.md).  
Corresponding prompt templates reside in `lib/prompts/`.

## Project Structure

- `lib/` â€“ core agent logic, flow helpers, and utilities
- `components/` â€“ reusable UI elements
- `pages/api/` â€“ Next.js API routes
- `supabase/` â€“ database schema and seed helpers

## Live Data Sources

Upcoming NFL matchups are fetched from [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/) and enriched with betting odds from [OddsAPI](https://the-odds-api.com/). The `/api/upcoming-games` endpoint exposes the top five games with team logos, kickoff times, and market lines.

## Available API Routes

- `GET /api/upcoming-games` â€“ list upcoming matchups (supports `?league=NFL`).
- `POST /api/run-predictions` â€“ run agent predictions for provided games.

## Authentication

EdgePicks uses [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) with Google OAuth. Users sign in with a Google account to run predictions and access protected routes.

## Logging

Predictions append entries to `llms.txt` using:

```
[timestamp] [league] predictions run by [username]
```

## run-agents Endpoint

Run all agents for a matchup via:

```
GET /api/run-agents?teamA=<team>&teamB=<team>&matchDay=<number>
```

Returns:

- Per-agent results (team, score, reason)
- Overall winner and confidence
- Logs the outcome to Supabase (if configured)

### Log Status Endpoint

Monitor the in-memory log queue via:
```
GET /api/log-status
```

This returns the number of pending log entries and the last error encountered (if any).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root for local development. The app
falls back to `.env` if `.env.local` is absent. Start by copying the example:

```sh
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then add your own keys:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<secure-generated-secret>
ODDS_API_KEY=<your-oddsapi-key>
SPORTS_DB_API_KEY=<your-thesportsdb-api-key>
SPORTS_DB_NFL_ID=<thesportsdb-nfl-league-id>
SPORTS_DB_MLB_ID=<thesportsdb-mlb-league-id>
SPORTS_DB_NBA_ID=<thesportsdb-nba-league-id>
SPORTS_DB_NHL_ID=<thesportsdb-nhl-league-id>
```

You can find the Supabase values in your dashboard under **Project Settings â†’ API**.
The NextAuth variables enable Google sign-in for protected routes.
`SPORTS_DB_API_KEY` is required for live schedule fetching from TheSportsDB.
`SPORTS_DB_NFL_ID` sets the TheSportsDB league ID for NFL (default `4391`). Use `SPORTS_DB_MLB_ID`, `SPORTS_DB_NBA_ID`, and `SPORTS_DB_NHL_ID` to configure other leagues. These values populate the `SPORTS_DB_LEAGUE_IDS` map in `lib/data/liveSports.ts`.

### Development Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev:local    # starts dev server at http://localhost:3000
```

Run tests locally:

```sh
npm run test:local
```

### Local API Tests
With the server running you can verify key routes:

```sh
curl -I http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/upcoming-games?league=NFL"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/run-agents
```

### Flow Execution
```
matchup â†’ agents â†’ logToSupabase â†’ accuracy updates
```

### Database Schema Notes
actual_winner â€“ actual outcome recorded post-game

is_auto_pick â€“ whether a selection was auto-generated

extras â€“ JSON field for additional metadata

### Updating Actual Results
After games conclude, record the real-world outcome so the leaderboard can track accuracy.
Update the `actual_winner` column in Supabase through the Table Editor or by running a query:

```
UPDATE matchups SET actual_winner = 'BOS' WHERE id = '<matchup-id>';
```
Rows without an outcome show "N/A" in the history page and are ignored in accuracy calculations.

ðŸ§± Adding New Agents or Data Sources
Create a new file in lib/agents/ exporting an AgentResult based on a Matchup.

Register the agent in:

lib/agents/pickBot.ts

pages/api/run-agents.ts

If needed, add data access via lib/supabaseClient.ts or new APIs.
Document the agent in codex-prompts/ (optional).
Test with npm run dev or curl to ensure end-to-end functionality.
