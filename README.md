# ðŸ§  EdgePicks

EdgePicks is an AI-powered research assistant for Pickâ€™em players, analysts, and fans. It combines modular agent logic and transparent reasoning to surface smart, explainable picks across matchupsâ€”whether you're tracking football, basketball, baseball, or beyond.

## Features

- Live predictions panel
- Transparency dashboards
- Accuracy leaderboards

## Project Purpose

EdgePicks helps users make informed predictions by aggregating insights from lightweight, explainable agents. Each agent contributes a score and rationale, allowing users to understand not just what to pickâ€”but why.

## Agent Architecture

Agents live in lib/agents/ and return an AgentResult describing:

the favored team

a confidence score

the reasoning behind the pick

Current agents include:

- injuryScout â€“ scans injury data for potential advantages
- lineWatcher â€“ monitors line movement for sharp betting behavior
- statCruncher â€“ evaluates team performance and efficiency
- trendsAgent â€“ analyzes historical and momentum trends
- guardianAgent â€“ raises warnings on risky or inconsistent picks

pickBot â€“ orchestrator that aggregates all agent scores into a final recommendation

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed agent metadata.

## Project Structure

- `lib/` â€“ core agent logic, flow helpers, and utilities
- `components/` â€“ reusable UI elements
- `pages/api/` â€“ Next.js API routes
- `supabase/` â€“ database schema and seed helpers

## API Endpoint

Run all agents for a matchup via:

GET /api/run-agents?teamA=<team>&teamB=<team>&matchDay=<number>

Returns:

Per-agent results (team, score, reason)

Overall winner and confidence

Logs the outcome to Supabase (if configured)

### Log Status Endpoint

Monitor the in-memory log queue via:

GET /api/log-status

This returns the number of pending log entries and the last error encountered (if any).

## Environment Variables

To enable Supabase integration, create a .env file in the project root:

SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>

You can find these values in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings â†’ API. They are required by lib/supabaseClient.ts to connect to your Supabase project.

## Development Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure values
3. `npm run dev` (starts dev server at `localhost:3000`)

## Flow Execution

matchup â†’ agents â†’ `logToSupabase` â†’ accuracy updates

## Database Schema Notes

- `actual_winner` â€“ actual outcome recorded post-game
- `is_auto_pick` â€“ whether a selection was auto-generated
- `extras` â€“ JSON field for additional metadata

## Updating Actual Results

After games conclude, record the real-world outcome so the leaderboard can track accuracy. Update the `actual_winner` column in Supabase via the Table Editor or SQL:

update matchups set actual_winner = 'BOS' where id = '<matchup-id>';

Rows without an outcome show N/A in the history page and are ignored in accuracy calculations.

ðŸ§± Adding New Agents or Data Sources

Create a new file in lib/agents/ exporting an AgentResult based on a Matchup.

Register the agent in:

lib/agents/pickBot.ts

pages/api/run-agents.ts

If needed, add data access via lib/supabaseClient.ts or new APIs.

Document the agent in codex-prompts/ (optional).

Test with npm run dev or curl command to ensure end-to-end functionality.
