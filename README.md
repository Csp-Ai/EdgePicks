# ðŸ§  EdgePicks

EdgePicks is an AI-powered research assistant for Pickâ€™em players, analysts, and fans. It combines modular agent logic and transparent reasoning to surface smart, explainable picks across matchupsâ€”whether you're tracking football, basketball, baseball, or beyond.

## ðŸ§¾ System Changelog: llms.txt

All Codex-driven changes, prompt pushes, and architecture modifications are documented in [`llms.txt`](llms.txt).  
This file serves as the **Codex constitution** and **single source of truth** for:

- What each agent does
- Why a prompt was executed
- What changed (code, logic, UI)
- When it was tested and deployed

**All future agents and developers must reference `llms.txt` before executing changes.**  
The README reflects system-level intent. The `llms.txt` file reflects execution history, behavior shifts, and rationale.

## Features

- Live predictions panel
- Transparency dashboards
- Accuracy leaderboards
- Upcoming games sourced from TheSportsDB with betting odds from OddsAPI

## Project Purpose

EdgePicks helps users make informed predictions by aggregating insights from lightweight, explainable agents. Each agent contributes a score and rationale, allowing users to understand not just what to pickâ€”but why.

## Agent Architecture

Agents live in `lib/agents/` and return an `AgentResult` describing:

- the favored team
- a confidence score
- the reasoning behind the pick

Current agents include:

- `injuryScout` â€“ scans injury data for potential advantages  
- `lineWatcher` â€“ monitors line movement for sharp betting behavior  
- `statCruncher` â€“ evaluates team performance and efficiency  
- `trendsAgent` â€“ analyzes historical and momentum trends  
- `guardianAgent` â€“ raises warnings on risky or inconsistent picks  

`pickBot` â€“ orchestrator that aggregates all agent scores into a final recommendation.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for detailed agent metadata.  
Prompt formats and guidelines are documented in [`agent-prompts.md`](agent-prompts.md).  
Corresponding prompt templates reside in `lib/prompts/`.

## Project Structure

- `lib/` â€“ core agent logic, flow helpers, and utilities
- `components/` â€“ reusable UI elements
- `pages/api/` â€“ Next.js API routes
- `supabase/` â€“ database schema and seed helpers

## Live Data Sources

Upcoming NFL matchups are fetched from [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/) and enriched with betting odds from [OddsAPI](https://the-odds-api.com/). The `/api/upcoming-games` endpoint exposes the top five games with team logos, kickoff times, and market lines.

## API Endpoint

Run all agents for a matchup via:

GET /api/run-agents?teamA=<team>&teamB=<team>&matchDay=<number>

markdown
Copy
Edit

Returns:

- Per-agent results (team, score, reason)
- Overall winner and confidence
- Logs the outcome to Supabase (if configured)

### Log Status Endpoint

Monitor the in-memory log queue via:

GET /api/log-status

bash
Copy
Edit

This returns the number of pending log entries and the last error encountered (if any).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root to configure Supabase, Google OAuth, and other services:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-deployed-url.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<secure-generated-secret>
ODDS_API_KEY=<your-oddsapi-key>
```

You can find the Supabase values in your dashboard under **Project Settings â†’ API**.  
The NextAuth variables enable Google sign-in for protected routes.

### Development Setup
npm install

Copy .env.example to .env and configure values

npm run dev (starts dev server at localhost:3000)

Flow Execution
nginx
Copy
Edit
matchup â†’ agents â†’ logToSupabase â†’ accuracy updates
Database Schema Notes
actual_winner â€“ actual outcome recorded post-game

is_auto_pick â€“ whether a selection was auto-generated

extras â€“ JSON field for additional metadata

Updating Actual Results
After games conclude, record the real-world outcome so the leaderboard can track accuracy.
Update the actual_winner column in Supabase via the Table Editor or SQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE matchups SET actual_winner = 'BOS' WHERE id = '<matchup-id>';
Rows without an outcome show "N/A" in the history page and are ignored in accuracy calculations.

ðŸ§± Adding New Agents or Data Sources
Create a new file in lib/agents/ exporting an AgentResult based on a Matchup.

Register the agent in:

lib/agents/pickBot.ts

pages/api/run-agents.ts

If needed, add data access via lib/supabaseClient.ts or new APIs.
Document the agent in codex-prompts/ (optional).
Test with npm run dev or curl to ensure end-to-end functionality.

ðŸ“ˆ Built-in Features
âœ… Responsive UI with confidence bars, reasoning summaries, and dark mode
ðŸ“Š Leaderboard to track agent performance over time
ðŸ§  Glossary to explain how agents work
ðŸ—‚ History page showing past evaluations
ðŸ”¬ Debug panel for raw/weighted score breakdowns
