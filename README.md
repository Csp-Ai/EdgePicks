## üßæ System Changelog: llms.txt

All Codex-driven changes, prompt pushes, and architecture modifications are documented in [`llms.txt`](llms.txt).  
This file serves as the **Codex constitution** and **single source of truth** for:

- What each agent does
- Why a prompt was executed
- What changed (code, logic, UI)
- When it was tested and deployed

**All future agents and developers must reference `llms.txt` before executing changes.**  
The README reflects system-level intent. The `llms.txt` file reflects execution history, behavior shifts, and rationale.

## üìò AI/ML Constitution

See [AIML_OVERVIEW.md](AIML_OVERVIEW.md) for the constitutional AI/ML architecture and governance.

## Git Hooks

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) to manage Git hooks. A pre-push hook runs `npm run postpush`, which executes `scripts/log-llms-entry.ts` and appends the latest commit details to `llms.txt`.

## Features

- Live predictions panel
- Transparency dashboards
- Accuracy leaderboards
- Upcoming games sourced from TheSportsDB with betting odds from OddsAPI

## Project Purpose

EdgePicks helps users make informed predictions by aggregating insights from lightweight, explainable agents. Each agent contributes a score and rationale, allowing users to understand not just what to pick‚Äîbut why.

## Agent Architecture

Agents live in `lib/agents/` and return an `AgentResult` describing:

- the favored team
- a confidence score
- the reasoning behind the pick

Current agents include:

- `injuryScout` ‚Äì scans injury data for potential advantages  
- `lineWatcher` ‚Äì monitors line movement for sharp betting behavior  
- `statCruncher` ‚Äì evaluates team performance and efficiency  
- `trendsAgent` ‚Äì analyzes historical and momentum trends  
- `guardianAgent` ‚Äì raises warnings on risky or inconsistent picks  

`pickBot` ‚Äì orchestrator that aggregates all agent scores into a final recommendation.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for detailed agent metadata.  
Prompt formats and guidelines are documented in [`agent-prompts.md`](agent-prompts.md).  
Corresponding prompt templates reside in `lib/prompts/`.

## Project Structure

- `lib/` ‚Äì core agent logic, flow helpers, and utilities
- `components/` ‚Äì reusable UI elements
- `pages/api/` ‚Äì Next.js API routes
- `supabase/` ‚Äì database schema and seed helpers

## Live Data Sources

Upcoming NFL matchups are fetched from [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/) and enriched with betting odds from [OddsAPI](https://the-odds-api.com/). The `/api/upcoming-games` endpoint exposes the top five games with team logos, kickoff times, and market lines.

## Available API Routes

- `GET /api/upcoming-games` ‚Äì list upcoming matchups (supports `?league=NFL`).
- `POST /api/run-predictions` ‚Äì run agent predictions for provided games.
 
### Sample Agent Output

```json
{
  "gameId": "1234",
  "finalConfidence": 0.86,
  "agents": {
    "injuryScout": { "score": 0.72, "reason": "Key WR out" },
    "lineWatcher": { "score": 0.65, "reason": "Line moved -2.5" }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

EdgePicks uses [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) with Google OAuth. Users sign in with a Google account to run predictions and access protected routes.

## Logging

Predictions append entries to `llms.txt` using:

```
[timestamp] [league] predictions run by [username]
```

## run-agents Endpoint

Run all agents for a matchup via:

```
GET /api/run-agents?teamA=<team>&teamB=<team>&matchDay=<number>
```

Returns:

- Per-agent results (team, score, reason)
- Overall winner and confidence
- Logs the outcome to Supabase (if configured)

Example stream snippet:

```text
data: {"type":"agent","name":"injuryScout","result":{"team":"KC","score":0.72,"reason":"Mahomes cleared"}}
data: {"type":"summary","matchup":{"homeTeam":"KC","awayTeam":"DEN","matchDay":1,"time":"","league":""},"agents":{"injuryScout":{"team":"KC","score":0.72,"reason":"Mahomes cleared"}},"pick":{"winner":"KC","confidence":0.72,"topReasons":["Mahomes cleared"]}}
```

### Log Status Endpoint

Monitor the in-memory log queue via:
```
GET /api/log-status
```

This returns the number of pending log entries and the last error encountered (if any).

## Flow Configurations

Flow presets live in the `flows/` directory as simple JSON files that list which agents should run for a request. Each config includes a human-friendly name and an ordered array of agent IDs:

```json
{
  "name": "Default NFL Flow",
  "agents": ["injuryScout", "statCruncher", "lineWatcher", "guardianAgent"]
}
```

Streaming endpoints accept a `flow` query parameter so you can select one of these configs. If omitted, `/api/run-agents` defaults to `football-pick` and `/api/trends` defaults to `trends`.

### SSE Examples

Use `curl` with `-N` to watch Server-Sent Events as they arrive:

```sh
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" "http://localhost:3000/api/run-agents?teamA=KC&teamB=DEN&matchDay=1&flow=football-pick"
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" "http://localhost:3000/api/trends?flow=trends"
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root for local development. The app
falls back to `.env` if `.env.local` is absent. Start by copying the example:

```sh
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then add your own keys:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-key>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<secure-generated-secret>
ODDS_API_KEY=<your-oddsapi-key>
SPORTS_API_KEY=<your-thesportsdb-api-key>
SPORTS_DB_NFL_ID=<thesportsdb-nfl-league-id>
SPORTS_DB_MLB_ID=<thesportsdb-mlb-league-id>
SPORTS_DB_NBA_ID=<thesportsdb-nba-league-id>
SPORTS_DB_NHL_ID=<thesportsdb-nhl-league-id>
```

Common TheSportsDB league IDs:

- NFL: `4391`
- MLB: `4424`
- NBA: `4387`
- NHL: `4380`

Use `.env.local` for local development and `.env.production` for deployments. Both files share the same keys, but missing values in production will cause the app to throw at startup to avoid silent failures. Run `npm run validate-env` to verify example files contain required variables. During `npm run dev`, a `missing-env-report.txt` file lists any required keys that are unset in your current environment.

You can find the Supabase values in your dashboard under **Project Settings ‚Üí API**.
The NextAuth variables enable Google sign-in for protected routes.
`SPORTS_API_KEY` is required for live schedule fetching from TheSportsDB.
`SPORTS_DB_NFL_ID` sets the TheSportsDB league ID for NFL (default `4391`). Use `SPORTS_DB_MLB_ID`, `SPORTS_DB_NBA_ID`, and `SPORTS_DB_NHL_ID` to configure other leagues. These values populate the `SPORTS_DB_LEAGUE_IDS` map in `lib/data/liveSports.ts`.

### Development Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev:local    # starts dev server at http://localhost:3000
```

### Testing

Run the default test suite with the pre-commit command:

```sh
npm test
```

For local development runs:

```sh
npm run test:local
```

### Local API Tests
With the server running you can verify key routes:

```sh
curl -I http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/upcoming-games?league=NFL"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/run-agents
```

### Flow Execution
```
matchup ‚Üí agents ‚Üí logToSupabase ‚Üí accuracy updates
```

### Database Schema Notes
actual_winner ‚Äì actual outcome recorded post-game

is_auto_pick ‚Äì whether a selection was auto-generated

extras ‚Äì JSON field for additional metadata

### Updating Actual Results
After games conclude, record the real-world outcome so the leaderboard can track accuracy.
Update the `actual_winner` column in Supabase through the Table Editor or by running a query:

```
UPDATE matchups SET actual_winner = 'BOS' WHERE id = '<matchup-id>';
```
Rows without an outcome show "N/A" in the history page and are ignored in accuracy calculations.

üß± Adding New Agents or Data Sources
Create a new file in lib/agents/ exporting an AgentResult based on a Matchup.

Register the agent in:

lib/agents/pickBot.ts

pages/api/run-agents.ts

If needed, add data access via lib/supabaseClient.ts or new APIs.
Document the agent in codex-prompts/ (optional).
Test with npm run dev or curl to ensure end-to-end functionality.
